    "1. You can pass in a different value for the \"dimensions\" parameter to the request body\n",
    "2. Open AI uses a method called Matryoshka Reprsentation Learning where the embeddings created are increasing in granularity. The idea being if you took the first N dimensions, that should be comparable to embedding in N dimensions, each incremental dimension adds to the granularity of the embedding but does not reflect a change to its previous embeddings. This is sort of like a decimal, where you can truncate the last n digits without losing any of the information in the first n digits. By including more digits, or dimensions, you only get to a more granular representation of the information. "

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

      "Hello! The \"best\" way to write a loop in Python depends on what you're trying to achieve, but generally, Python's `for` loops and `while` loops are both very useful and have their ideal use cases.\n",

      "Here’s a brief overview to help you write effective loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a `for` loop\n",
      "`for` loops are great when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Looping through a list\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to loop a specific number of times:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a `while` loop\n",
      "`while` loops are useful when you want to repeat something until a condition changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "- Prefer `for` loops when iterating over collections or a known number of iterations.\n",
      "- Use `while` loops when the number of repetitions depends on a condition changing within the loop.\n",
      "- Make sure to update the loop variable or condition within `while` loops to avoid infinite loops.\n",
      "- Keep the loop body as simple as possible.\n",
      "- Use descriptive variable names for readability.\n",

      "Response: Based on the provided excerpts from the investor letter, several key investment themes emerge:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pursuit of Competitive Advantage Through Sophistication and Operational Excellence**  \n",
      "   The letter discusses Stone Ridge's initial belief that breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology, resulting in an edge in cost of funds, would suffice for best-in-class investment performance in energy markets (Source 1). However, they learned that financial sophistication alone is insufficient without industrial control and operational expertise. This led them to partner with Flywheel Energy, recognized for superior operations partly due to their leadership's elite military backgrounds. This highlights a theme of combining financial innovation with operational mastery to achieve superior investment outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Long-Term Perseverance and Search for Value**  \n",
      "   Stone Ridge draws an analogy to the long search for the treasure of the Atocha shipwreck, emphasizing patience and persistence over thousands of days (Source 2). This metaphor reflects a commitment to disciplined, long-term investing with a focus on discovering undervalued opportunities that might require sustained effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Partnership and Shared Mission with Investors**  \n",
      "   The firm expresses gratitude toward its investors and emphasizes the partnership ethos: investors provide capital to fuel innovation and product development, while Stone Ridge contributes deep expertise in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management (Source 2). This theme showcases a collaborative approach where aligned incentives and shared dedication to financial security underpin their operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management and Selective Investment Approach in Complex Markets**  \n",
      "   In their reinsurance business (Longtail Re), initiated in 2020, Stone Ridge focuses on partnering with top underwriters to build a hyper-diversified portfolio of casualty liabilities that generate low-cost float, which is then deployed into proprietary fixed income strategies (Source 3). They are cautious of adverse selection and highlight the importance of selectivity and avoiding superficially attractive but risky trades. The firm underscores its philosophy of prudent risk transfer pricing and strategic partnerships rather than competing with established legacy underwriters.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Innovation Amidst Uncertainty**  \n",
      "   The letter communicates a forward-looking theme of innovating to prepare for an uncertain future and pursuing the mission of financial security for all (Source 2). This suggests a broad investment philosophy oriented towards adaptive strategies and continuous product development in the face of changing market and economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key investment themes include leveraging proprietary financial and operational advantages, long-term value discovery with persistence, strong partnership alignment with investors, disciplined and selective risk management especially in insurance-related markets, and ongoing innovation to address uncertainty and secure financial outcomes.\n",

    "Enhance your Stone Ridge Investor Letter Assistant in some way! \n",

    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Document Support**: Allow it to ingest multiple investor letters from different years for historical comparison\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for financial content?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like year, topic categories (market outlook, strategy, performance) to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for financial content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from SEC filings, earnings calls, or other financial documents\n",

      "Response: Comparing the themes from Stone Ridge’s 2020 and 2023 investor letters reveals both continuity and evolution in their investment philosophy and market insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2020 Themes:\n",
      "- The 2020 letters emphasize foundational macroeconomic insights, focusing on \"sound money\" and the deep systemic impacts of central banking policies, particularly the Federal Reserve's role since its founding in 1913. The letters critique modern central banking as a \"helicopter parent,\" distorting natural market Darwinism and economic price signals, which are crucial for proper coordination in the economy (Sources 1, 2, 3).\n",
      "- There is a pronounced concern about the unfairness and distortion caused by government policy money (GPM), its effect on inequality, and the resulting economic dislocations. The reflections include a philosophical tone about reconsidering what is \"real and essential,\" analogous to how fish relate to water (Source 1).\n",
      "- Monetary pluralism and its evolution over time are acknowledged as essential for civilization’s development (Source 2).\n",
      "- The 2020 letters contain skepticism about the prevailing monetary system’s sustainability and fairness, underscoring the long-term consequences of price signal degradation and wealth inequality triggered by monetary policy actions (Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2023 Themes:\n",
      "- The 2023 letters lean more into operational reflections and strategic positioning, blending market realities with internal performance and decision-making. For instance, the firm highlights its ability to generate nearly $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits with no down months, emphasizing perseverance and learning from prior setbacks such as failed fund launches or unexpected defaults among mining clients (Source 4).\n",
      "- There is a more granular focus on investment behavior dynamics, especially the distinction between principals investing their own money versus agents investing on behalf of others. The \"agent\" problem leads to suboptimal capital allocation—agents avoid certain asset classes like reinsurance despite better risk-return profiles due to career risk concerns (Source 5).\n",
      "- The letters also explore nuanced asset class dynamics, giving art investment categories as an example: highlighting how newer categories (like Post-War and Contemporary art) command higher returns due to behavioral factors (billionaire wealth creation, desire for \"new new\" art) and risk-based asset pricing analogies (small-value stocks of art) (Source 6).\n",
      "- The 2023 letter acknowledges today's economic and investment complexity with a strategic lens, dealing with investor behavior, return patterns across vintages, and the impact of modern macroeconomic forces like globalization and central bank money printing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary Comparison:\n",
      "- The 2020 letters present a broad, deep macroeconomic and monetary theory critique highlighting systemic distortions and long-term structural risks.\n",
      "- The 2023 letters integrate those philosophical foundations with a sharper focus on practical investment execution, market realities, and behavioral finance insights affecting asset allocation and returns.\n",
      "- Both years share a critical perspective on central bank policies and distorted incentives but 2023 adds concrete examples of firm-level performance and detailed behavioral impediments in markets.\n",
      "- The evolution reflects a movement from understanding systemic macroeconomic forces to applying that understanding to asset allocation and investment strategy amid contemporary challenges.\n",
