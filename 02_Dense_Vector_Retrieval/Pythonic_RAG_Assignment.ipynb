    "1. You can pass in a different value for the \"dimensions\" parameter to the request body\n",
    "2. Open AI uses a method called Matryoshka Reprsentation Learning where the embeddings created are increasing in granularity. The idea being if you took the first N dimensions, that should be comparable to embedding in N dimensions, each incremental dimension adds to the granularity of the embedding but does not reflect a change to its previous embeddings. This is sort of like a decimal, where you can truncate the last n digits without losing any of the information in the first n digits. By including more digits, or dimensions, you only get to a more granular representation of the information. "

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

      "Hello! The \"best\" way to write a loop in Python depends on what you're trying to achieve, but generally, Python's `for` loops and `while` loops are both very useful and have their ideal use cases.\n",

      "Here’s a brief overview to help you write effective loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a `for` loop\n",
      "`for` loops are great when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Looping through a list\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to loop a specific number of times:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a `while` loop\n",
      "`while` loops are useful when you want to repeat something until a condition changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "- Prefer `for` loops when iterating over collections or a known number of iterations.\n",
      "- Use `while` loops when the number of repetitions depends on a condition changing within the loop.\n",
      "- Make sure to update the loop variable or condition within `while` loops to avoid infinite loops.\n",
      "- Keep the loop body as simple as possible.\n",
      "- Use descriptive variable names for readability.\n",

      "Response: Based on the provided excerpts from the investor letter, several key investment themes emerge:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pursuit of Competitive Advantage Through Sophistication and Operational Excellence**  \n",
      "   The letter discusses Stone Ridge's initial belief that breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology, resulting in an edge in cost of funds, would suffice for best-in-class investment performance in energy markets (Source 1). However, they learned that financial sophistication alone is insufficient without industrial control and operational expertise. This led them to partner with Flywheel Energy, recognized for superior operations partly due to their leadership's elite military backgrounds. This highlights a theme of combining financial innovation with operational mastery to achieve superior investment outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Long-Term Perseverance and Search for Value**  \n",
      "   Stone Ridge draws an analogy to the long search for the treasure of the Atocha shipwreck, emphasizing patience and persistence over thousands of days (Source 2). This metaphor reflects a commitment to disciplined, long-term investing with a focus on discovering undervalued opportunities that might require sustained effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Partnership and Shared Mission with Investors**  \n",
      "   The firm expresses gratitude toward its investors and emphasizes the partnership ethos: investors provide capital to fuel innovation and product development, while Stone Ridge contributes deep expertise in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management (Source 2). This theme showcases a collaborative approach where aligned incentives and shared dedication to financial security underpin their operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management and Selective Investment Approach in Complex Markets**  \n",
      "   In their reinsurance business (Longtail Re), initiated in 2020, Stone Ridge focuses on partnering with top underwriters to build a hyper-diversified portfolio of casualty liabilities that generate low-cost float, which is then deployed into proprietary fixed income strategies (Source 3). They are cautious of adverse selection and highlight the importance of selectivity and avoiding superficially attractive but risky trades. The firm underscores its philosophy of prudent risk transfer pricing and strategic partnerships rather than competing with established legacy underwriters.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Innovation Amidst Uncertainty**  \n",
      "   The letter communicates a forward-looking theme of innovating to prepare for an uncertain future and pursuing the mission of financial security for all (Source 2). This suggests a broad investment philosophy oriented towards adaptive strategies and continuous product development in the face of changing market and economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key investment themes include leveraging proprietary financial and operational advantages, long-term value discovery with persistence, strong partnership alignment with investors, disciplined and selective risk management especially in insurance-related markets, and ongoing innovation to address uncertainty and secure financial outcomes.\n",

    "Enhance your Stone Ridge Investor Letter Assistant in some way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Document Support**: Allow it to ingest multiple investor letters from different years for historical comparison\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for financial content?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like year, topic categories (market outlook, strategy, performance) to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for financial content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from SEC filings, earnings calls, or other financial documents\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are suggestions, you should feel free to make whatever augmentations you desire! Think about what features would make this investor letter assistant most useful for understanding Stone Ridge's investment approach.\n",

In Python, “best” depends on what you’re trying to do. Here’s a quick, Pythonic guide with patterns to choose from:\\n\\n- Iterate over items (default)\\n  for x in items:\\n      ...\\n\\n- Need index and value\\n  for i, x in enumerate(items):  # optionally enumerate(items, start=1)\\n      ...\\n\\n- Iterate two (or more) sequences together\\n  for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list):\\n      ...\\n\\n- Fixed number of times\\n  for _ in range(n):\\n      ...\\n\\n- Loop until a condition changes\\n  while condition:\\n      ...\\n\\n- Build a new collection (prefer comprehensions)\\n  squares = [x*x for x in nums]              # list\\n  evens = {x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0}    # set\\n  mapping = {x: x*x for x in nums}           # dict\\n\\n- Stream values without making a list (generator)\\n  total = sum(x*x for x in nums if x > 0)\\n\\n- Search with clean “not found” handling (for–else)\\n  for user in users:\\n      if user.id == target:\\n          found = user\\n          break\\n  else:\\n      found = None\\n\\n- Iterate dictionaries correctly\\n  for key, value in my_dict.items():\\n      ...\\n\\n- Reverse, sorted, or with custom order\\n  for x in reversed(seq): ...\\n  for k in sorted(my_dict): ...\\n\\nBest practices and tips\\n- Prefer iterating directly over items; avoid range(len(seq)) unless you truly need indices.\\n- Use clear variable names and small loop bodies; extract helper functions if logic grows.\\n- Don’t mutate a list you’re iterating. Either iterate over a copy (for x in list(lst):) or build a new list.\\n- Use built-ins for aggregates: sum, min, max, any, all with generator expressions.\\n- Avoid string concatenation in a loop; accumulate and ''.join(parts) at the end.\\n- For performance-heavy numeric work, consider NumPy/Pandas (vectorization).\\n- Explore itertools (chain, islice, groupby, accumulate) for efficient, readable pipelines.\\n\\nCommon mini-patterns\\n- Count things: from collections import Counter; counts = Counter(items)\\n- Pair neighbors: for a, b in zip(items, items[1:]): ...\\n- Index starting at 1: for i, x in enumerate(items, 1): ...\\n\\nIf you share what you’re looping over and what outcome you want (transform, filter, search, side effects, early exit, etc.), I can suggest the most fitting pattern with a tailored example.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1770251276, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1708, prompt_tokens=35, total_tokens=1743, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=1152, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"
